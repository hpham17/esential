## About esential

Esential is a non-profit organization that aims to connect local communities with low-income individuals who are in need of a low interest rate loan. By signing up for an account, community members will be able to list the amount they wish to loan with a desired interest rate. Individuals in need will be able to search for a loan whose terms they can agree on and arrange to meet in person with the loaner.

Please visit our [website](https://esential-2016.herokuapp.com) to get involved.
