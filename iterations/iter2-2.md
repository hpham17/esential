Iter 2-1 User Stories

1. As a lender (Community), after logging in, I should be able to see my community page, so that I can edit or update it.

2. As a borrower,
after logging in,
I should be able to see list of all communities,  so that I can choose one, and find a loan.

3. As the admin, after logging in, I should be able to see two links to the lists of all communities and borrowers, so that I can manage them, and be able to delete users.
