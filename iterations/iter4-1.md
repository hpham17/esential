As a user, when I search for community's
I should see a drop down "suggestions" bar,
while I type in the name of the community,
so I can type in the correct community with the correct spelling

As a borrower and a lender,
I should be able to sign up and login using my Facebook or gmail account information,
so that it is easy to sign up and login.

As a borrower,
I should be able to log on and see a Google map of all the communities,
so that I can find communities within my proximity quickly.
